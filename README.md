## Compatibility
- Incompatible with
  - Any Police Script Mod
  - Any Wanted Level Changing Mod
  - Story Mode (Most Likely)
  - Can you make it work with XXX? No.
- Do not save and turn off autosave
- Restart the game without the mod active before saving (does some memory editing)

## Issues
- This is an alpha, expect crashes/low performance
- Peds and Cops may react unexpectedly, AI programming is hard
- Some settings are not implemented/ do not exist
- Turning off some settings may cause other unexpected issues, mostly tested with everything ON
- If the mod doesn't load/can't get to the settings page, Once you are successfully loaded into SinglePlayer with RagePluginHook press F4. Type: ReloadAllPlugins and press Enter.
- If you delete the xml files, they will be recreated on next launch with the default settings.
- If you have crashes, please post the contents of your RagePluginHook.log file (located in the root GTA V directory). This will allow me to quickly see the exact error.
